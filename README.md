NACA AIRFOIL

The NACA airfoils are airfoil shapes for aircraft wings developed by the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA). 
The shape of the NACA airfoils is described using a series of digits following the word "NACA". 
The parameters in the numerical code can be entered into equations to precisely generate the cross-section of the airfoil and calculate its properties.
